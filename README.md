This is a repository that presents all three revised projects in the course: PHP 2550 Fall 2022
Detailed codes and reports are each stored at respective branches to this repository. The following are a short introduction to the three projects:


Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis on Tobacco Exposure and Adolescent Behavior

Introduction:
This exploratory data analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Lauren Micalizzi from the Department of Behavioral and Social Sciences, aims to elucidate the impact of smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) on adolescent behavior. Leveraging data from a smoke avoidance intervention study, we investigate self-regulation, substance use, and externalizing behaviors in a subset of adolescents and their mothers. The analysis synthesizes demographic, diagnostic, and exposure data, aiming to contribute to the development of targeted public health interventions.

Project 2: Predictive Modeling for Severe Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Outcomes

Introduction:
In partnership with Dr. Robin McKinney, MD from Alpert Medical School at Brown University, and Dr. Chris Schmid from the Biostatistics Department, this project seeks to develop regression models predicting the need for tracheostomy or risk of mortality in infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (sBPD). Utilizing the BPD Collaborative Registry, we harness multicenter data from the United States and Sweden, focusing on detailed respiratory parameters to improve clinical decision-making and patient counseling regarding tracheostomy timing.


Project 3: Transportability Analysis for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Models

Introduction:
This project is an analytical venture to assess the transportability of cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction models from the Framingham Heart Study to a broader population represented by the NHANES database, We followed the methodology outlined in the reference paper "Transporting a Prediction Model for Use in a New Target Population" by Dr. Jon A Steingrimsson and his colleagues. we strive to develop a statistical framework that accommodates varying demographic and clinical factors. Different simulation mechanisms are used to test for tranportability.
