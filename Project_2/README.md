Introduction:

This report outlines a predictive modeling approach for tracheostomy placement need in severe bronchopulmonary
dysplasia (sBPD). Collaborating with Dr. Robin McKinney, MD and Dr. Chris Schmid, we utilize
the BPD Collaborative Registry, which provides demographic, diagnostic, and respiratory data for infants
with sBPD across different NICUs. The data, capturing respiratory support parameters in both 36 and
44 weeks informs the development of our regression models. Despite challenges such as missing values, our
analysis aims to offer clinicians data-driven guidance on tracheostomy placement, potentially enhancing care
for sBPD patients.
