Introduction:

Our study, led by Dr. Lauren Micalizzi from the Department of Behavioral and Social Sciences, aims to
understand how smoking during pregnancy and exposure to secondhand smoke affect children as they grow
into teenagers. We are using data from a previous study of 800 pregnant women and a focused group of 100
of their children, tracking how early exposure to smoke relates to behaviors like self-control, substance use.
The goal is to get a clear picture of how smoke exposure in early life might lead to behavioral challenges
later on, which could help in creating better public health policies.
